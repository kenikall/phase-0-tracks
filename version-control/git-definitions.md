# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control keeps track of the different iterations of your work. This is useful becasue if there is ever an error you can always go back to an old version of a file if ther is an error.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
Branches are copies of repositories and files that mirror the original code but can be changed. Changed code can then be reintergrated into the live app. The benifit of using brances is that multiple people can work on the same code simultaneously and changes can be vetted before being applied.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
Commit is similar to saving. After making your changes to a file, (or files), in a branch that you want to merge with the original master branch those files must be added, then commited to upload the changes and make them mergeable.

* What is a merge conflict?
If there is an attempt to merge changes to what already exists then there is a merge conflict. When a merge confilct occurs you are prompted and you must decide which code you will be keeping and which you will be rejecting before proceeding.
