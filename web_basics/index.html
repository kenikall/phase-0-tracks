		<h1>Brief Introduction to Street Fighter II</h1>
		<h2><i>Since this is just practice I lifted a lot of this text from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_II:_The_World_Warrior">wikipedia</a></i></h2>
		<p>Street Fighter II: The World Warrior is a competitive fighting game originally released for the arcades in 1991. It is the second entry in the Street Fighter series and the arcade sequel to the original Street Fighter released in 1987. It is Capcom's fourteenth title that runs on the CP System arcade hardware. Street Fighter II improves upon the many concepts introduced in the first game, including the use of command-based special moves and a six-button configuration, while offering players a selection of <strong>multiple playable characters</strong>, each with their own <em>unique fighting style</em>, and introducing a <em>combo system</em> and <em>competitive combat</em> between two players.</p>
